# ‚úàÔ∏è Sky Analytics: Airline & Airport Operations Dashboard

This project explores and analyzes real-world flight data to uncover insights about airline performance, airport connectivity, delays, cancellations, and aircraft utilization. The analysis is done entirely using **Microsoft Excel**, demonstrating the power of Excel for handling large datasets, building pivot tables, and visualizing complex relationships.

## üìÇ Datasets Used

- **flights.csv** ‚Äì Details on flight schedules, delays, and airline codes.
- **airports.csv** ‚Äì Metadata about airports, including location (latitude, longitude), IATA codes, and city/state info.
- **airlines.csv** ‚Äì Airline names and their corresponding codes.

## üìä Key Analyses Performed

- **Top 5 Busiest Airports** by incoming/outgoing flights
- **Flight Connectivity**: Airports with the highest number of unique destinations
- **Average Flight Delays** per airline (departure & arrival)
- **Cancellation Analysis** by airline and reason
- **Fleet Utilization** based on number of flights per aircraft
- **Geographical Distribution** of airports (using 3D Maps and latitude/longitude)
- **Seasonal Trends** in delays and cancellations
- **Cumulative Delay Impact**: Combined frequency and severity of delays
- **Scheduled vs Actual Flight Duration**: Deviation and standard deviation
- **Time-of-Day Analysis** using categorized time blocks (Morning, Afternoon, etc.)
